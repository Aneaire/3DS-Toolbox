## üîß Building from Source

To build the executable yourself:

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build the executable
python build_windows_exe.py
```

This creates `dist/3DS_Decryptor_GUI.exe` and a distribution package.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Failed to run decryption script"**
- Ensure all .exe files (decrypt.exe, ctrtool.exe, makerom.exe) are in the same folder
- Run as Administrator if needed

**"File not found" errors**
- Make sure your 3DS/CIA files are not read-only
- Check file paths don't contain special characters

**Antivirus warnings**
- The executable may trigger false positives
- Add to antivirus exceptions if needed

### Log Analysis:
- Use the "Copy Log" button to copy output
- Check for specific error messages
- Ensure you have enough disk space (2x file size recommended)

## üìù How It Works

1. **File Selection** - Browse and select your encrypted file
2. **Temporary Processing** - File is copied to app directory for decryption
3. **Decryption** - Uses proven tools (decrypt.exe, ctrtool.exe, makerom.exe)
4. **File Return** - Decrypted files are moved back to original location
5. **Cleanup** - Temporary files are automatically removed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety

- **No Internet Required** - Works completely offline
- **No Data Collection** - All processing happens locally
- **Temporary Files Only** - Original files remain untouched unless you choose to delete
- **Confirmation Prompts** - Delete actions require explicit confirmation

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the log output for specific error messages
2. Ensure all required files are present
3. Try running as Administrator
4. Check available disk space

## üîÑ Updates

The GUI automatically remembers your settings between sessions:
- Last used directory
- Window position (if supported by your system)
